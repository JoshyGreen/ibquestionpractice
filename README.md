# IB Questionbank 2025 - Physics & Chemistry

Welcome to the **IB Questionbank 2025** project! This repository is a collection of questions organized according to the topics in the updated 2025 IB Physics and IB Chemistry syllabuses. 
<!---
It is designed to serve as a valuable resource for students and educators to efficiently access relevant questions for study and teaching.
-->
## 📂 Project Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories: **Physics** and **Chemistry**, each containing subfolders corresponding to the topics in the respective syllabus. Questions are further the paper they appear and the marks they are worth.


## 🚀 Features
- **Fully Aligned to the 2025 Syllabus:** The questions are mapped directly to topics and subtopics in the new syllabus.
- **Varied Question Types:** Includes multiple-choice, structured questions, and data-response formats.
- **Mark Schemes:** The offical markschemes are included with each question.

### 🛠️ Coming Soon
- **Physics:** The files for the IB Physics curriculum have yet to be added
- **Difficulty Levels:** We are hoping to soon add a **SL/HL** filter on the questions
- **Question Filters:** We aim to have users the ability to extract a collection of the questions according to given conditions
  - This will include the ability to mark off questions as completed, so that they do not reappear.  

## 🧭 How to Use This Repository

1. **Navigate Topics:** Use the directory structure to locate the desired topic. For example:
   -  To find questions reguarding the properties of single, double, or triple bonds, navigate to `Chemistry --> Structure 2 --> Structure 2.2 --> Structure 2.2.2`.

2. **Access Questions:** Each topic folder contains:
   - A folder of the available question types (Paper 1A, Paper 1B, Paper 2)
   - Each folder contains at least one question file, in the form of a `.html` file.
    - Each `.html` file containes a question and its corresponding markscheme, which is hidden and can be displayed by a button.
      - Some files in the paper 2 folders might have several parts, in which case all markschemes are included, and hidden at the bottom of the page in the question order. 

3. **Practice:** Use the questions for self-study or teaching. Compare your answers with the provided mark schemes for feedback.
